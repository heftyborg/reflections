Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git creates an empty repository getting ready to track files. It creates .git
folder to store its data. We need to initialize repository to prepare its
working environment before we could start tracking file changes.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area is a special state(?) of the repository allowing us to prepare
changes that we would like to save to repository in the next commit. It may
contain not all changes in the working directory but a specific subset of the
changes(files). It allows us to be more specific and precise when preparing
commits.
