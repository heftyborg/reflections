Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Using remote repositories is an easy way to share your work with others and participate
in others projects.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Automatic changes pull might break your local copy of files before its finished and
ready for publishing (pushing to remote).

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one
instead of another?

A: Forks basically are clones of a repository within GitHub eco-system. Clones are copys
of an existing repository whether its local or remote repositories. Branches are a part of
repository used to separate working copy from experimental features. We would use fork
when we do not have access to editing someone elses repository. After forking a repo on
GitHub we can create a local forked repo clone and be able to make changes to it (push/pull).
