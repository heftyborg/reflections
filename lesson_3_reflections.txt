Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A: Using remote repositories is an easy way to share your work with others and participate
in others projects.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Automatic changes pull might break your local copy of files before its finished and
ready for publishing (pushing to remote).
